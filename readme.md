## How to install
#### Windows
1. Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
    + GTRP Client uses 100% AutoHotkey scripts to function

3. Close Growtopia if it's running
4. Open your Growtopia installation folder
    + This is usually located in `C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Growtopia`
    + To find your Growtopia installation folder, right click the Growtopia shortcut on your desktop and click "Open file location"
5. Extract the contents of `GTRP 1.x.zip` to `Growtopia`
6. Extract resprite installations to `Resprites`
    + This is where all resprite installs will go
    + An example resprite named `GTRP-client` can be used as a reference
    + More info about installing resprites can be found at each resprite's `readme.md` and the wiki
7. Run GTRP 1.x.ahk
    + `Growtopia.exe` will be run by the client itself.

For instructions on how to create resprites, please visit the wiki.

> Powered by Growtopia Resprite Project - All resprites are "client-side" modifications. Modified textures will only appear on your client, and everyone else will not see the resprite, unless they also have the same resprites.
