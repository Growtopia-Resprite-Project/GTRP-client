## How to install
#### Windows
1. Close Growtopia if it's running
2. Open your Growtopia installation folder
    + This is usually located in `C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Growtopia`
    + To find your Growtopia installation folder, right click the Growtopia shortcut on your desktop and click "Open file location"
3. Extract the contents of `GTRP 1.x.zip` to `Growtopia`
4. Create a new folder in `Growtopia` named `Resprites`. This is where downloaded resprites will go
5. Run GTRP 1.x.ahk
    + `Growtopia.exe` will be run by the client itself.

For instructions on how to create and install resprites, please visit the wiki.

> Powered by Growtopia Resprite Project - All resprites are "client-side" modifications. Modified textures will only appear on your client, and everyone else will not see the resprite, unless they also have the same resprites.
